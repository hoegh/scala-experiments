This is not as much "a" project as it is a collection of experiments and prototypes
not quite big enough to become projects on their own yet. And that's why you should
consult the toplevel directories to look for README files there as well.

There is a wiki for this as well: 
  http://wiki.github.com/hoegh/scala-experiments
and that might be a good place to look as well.

There is one common denominator, though, and that is that the primary language will
be Scala ( http://www.scala-lang.org/ ). The time hasn't come for automated build
and dependency management yet, but it might very well be some odd ant scripts 
combined with for instance Ivy ( http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ )
